    Abstract base class for instance definitions. Built-in derived classes are
    listed :doc:`here <instances>`.

    Each instance must define a :py:attr:`name` attribute that is used to
    reference the instance on the command line. The name must be unique among
    all registered instances.

    An instance changes variables in the :py:attr:`configuration context
    <Setup.ctx>` that are used to apply instrumentation while building a target
    by :func:`Target.build` and :func:`Target.link`. This is done by
    :func:`configure`.

    Additionally, instances that need runtime support, such as a shared library,
    can implement :func:`prepare_run` which is called by the ``run`` command
    just before running the target with :func:`Target.run`.

        instance name to avoid collisions with other instances and targets.
