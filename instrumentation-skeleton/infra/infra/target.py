class Target(metaclass=ABCMeta):
    """
    Abstract base class for target definitions. Built-in derived classes are
    listed :doc:`here <targets>`.

    Each target must define a :py:attr:`name` attribute that is used to
    reference the target on the command line. The name must be unique among all
    registered targets. Each target must also implement a number of methods
    that are called by :class:`Setup` when running commands.

    The :ref:`build <usage-build>` command follows the following steps for each
    target:

    #. It calls :func:`add_build_args` to include any custom command-line
       arguments for this target, and then parses the command-line arguments.
    #. It calls :func:`is_fetched` to see if the source code for this target
       has been downloaded yet.
    #. If ``is_fetched() == False``, it calls :func:`fetch`.
    #. It calls :func:`Instance.configure` on the instance that will be passed
       to :func:`build`.
    #. All packages listed by :func:`dependencies` are built and installed into
       the environment (i.e., ``PATH`` and such are set).
    #. Unless ``--relink`` was passed on the command line, it calls
       :func:`build` to build the target object files.
    #. It calls :func:`link` to link the target binaries.
    #. If any post-build hooks are installed by the current instance, it calls
       :func:`binary_paths` to get paths to all built binaries. These are then
       passed directly to the build hooks.

    For the :ref:`run <usage-run>` command:

    #. It calls :func:`add_run_args` to include any custom command-line
       arguments for this target.
    #. If ``--build`` was specified, it performs all build steps above.
    #. It calls :func:`Instance.prepare_run` on the instance that will be passed
       to :func:`run`.
    #. It calls :func:`run` to run the target binaries.

    For the :ref:`clean <usage-clean>` command:

    #. It calls :func:`is_clean` to see if any build files exist for this target.
    #. If ``is_clean() == False``, it calls :func:`clean`.

    For the :ref:`report <usage-report>` command:

    #. It calls :func:`add_report_args` to include any custom command-line
       arguments for this target.
    #. It calls :func:`report`.

    Naturally, when defining your own target, all the methods listed above must
    have working implementations. Some implementations are optional and some
    have a default implementation that works for almost all cases (see docs
    below), but the following are mandatory to implement for each new target:
    :func:`is_fetched`, :func:`fetch`, :func:`build`, :func:`link` and
    :func:`run`.

        implement :func:`link` and link the target binaries here instead (since
        some build systems are not flexible enough for this).

        ``ctx.runenv`` will have been populated with the exported environments
        of all packages returned by :func:`dependencies` (i.e.,
        :func:`Package.install_env` has been called for each dependency). This
        means that when you call :func:`util.run` here, the programs and
        libraries from the dependencies are available in ``PATH`` and
        ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH``, so you don't need to reference them with absolute
        paths.

        The build function should respect variables set in the configuration
        context such as ``ctx.cc`` and ``ctx.cflags``, passing them to the
        underlying build system as required. :py:attr:`Setup.ctx` shows default
        variables in the context that should at least be respected, but complex
        instances may optionally overwrite them to be used by custom targets.

        Any custom command-line arguments set by :func:`add_build_args` are

        An implementation of :func:`build` may optionally define a parameter

        when ``--parallel`` is passed. In that case, ``pool`` will be an object
        of type :class:`Pool`, and the method should call :func:`pool.run()
        <parallel.Pool.run>` instead of :func:`util.run` to invoke build
        commands.
