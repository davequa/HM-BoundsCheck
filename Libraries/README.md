These libraries are the standard thread-safe libraries built to accommodate for (almost) all possible configurations. The libraries actually used in the instrumentation-skeleton are inlined and optimised to work for the SPEC2006 benchmarking system, where all traces of thread-safety measures (mutexes, etc) have been removed. The versions here are not inlined, resulting in a very large runtime overhead. Inlining these libraries is still on the to-do list (future work).
